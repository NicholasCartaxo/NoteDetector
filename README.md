# NoteDetector
C# application that applies FFT to discern major frequencies in live audio, giving game-specific input.
Uses NAudio to capture live audio from microphone, and applies Fast Fourier Transform to get the predominant frequency in audio, corresponding that to specific keyboard output.
Utilizes a UI to facilitate changing input devices and disabling the funcionality, also it implements a visualizer of the major frequency and the corresponding key output.
